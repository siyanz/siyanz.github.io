# Get into the mode: Modal text editing simulation

## Background
This prototype is a simulation of the user experience of some of the earliest text editing interfaces, as described in Larry Tesler's paper: [A personal history of modeless text editing and cut/copy-paste](https://github.com/devinmcgloin/theory/blob/master/worrydream/Tesler%20-%20A%20Personal%20History%20of%20Modeless%20Text%20Editing%20and%20Cut-Copy-Paste.pdf). In addition to the text editing simulation, the design also features some informational text, quoted from Tesler’s paper, that describes the usability issues associated with modal editors.

I used the following libraries to create the prototype: jQuery, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts.

## Interaction
Users can click on the different modes to either type, delete text, or move text. The user must be in the proper mode to complete any of these actions, and must click the “back up” button to change modes. After completing an action, the editor goes back to the start mode.
