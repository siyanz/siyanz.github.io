interview.meA website for live UX interview practiceThis website is designed to be used in conjunction with a mirror to mimic live practice without the need of finding an actual partner to conduct a mock interview. This would be beneficial for people who cannot find mock interview partners or for those who are first starting out and are uncomfortable with practicing in front of another person. More information can be found in the “About” section of the site.Built using Bootstrap & JQuery.
