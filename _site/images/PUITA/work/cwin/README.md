## What is UX Design?

This website explains what UX Design is in a simple, interactive, and easy-to understand way for people who have no exposure to design. It can be sent to people such as relatives, friends, co-workers, bosses, and business people. The goal is to bridge the gap between other roles and UX Designers and also increase awareness of the value of UX Design in general.
