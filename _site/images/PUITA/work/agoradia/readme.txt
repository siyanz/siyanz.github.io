Project By Akshay Goradia

After numerous iterations, this project is aimed to be a color picking tool for web/graphic designers. They can create a color scheme by comparing colors to each other to see what looks best in combinations. Users can manipulate hue, saturation and lightness. It will additionally generate a random palette every time the page is loaded for inspiration. Finally, html color codes are dynamically displayed for the users!

NOTE: When we met, I know we mentioned exploring how to display the sliders and perhaps doing an on hover effect. Through user testing however, I found that users wanted all the sliders to display to make it simpler. Also, they preferred seeing all the sliders so they could easily compare values (such as saturation & lightness) between colors.

I used:

- Bootstrap
- RangeSlider.js (http://rangeslider.js.org/)
- Functions on StackOverflow to convert hsl/rgb/hex color values (they are appropriately given credit in the comments in the code, but theyâ€™re below as well)
