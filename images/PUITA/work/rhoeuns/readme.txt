This project is for assignment 6 on 05-430(Programing usable interface) course. 

I enjoy coding, and decided to make my theme into a dektop
computer with terminal.

Important note:
    1. Please use google chrome to open this file
    2. Individual project page is under construction
        -only Metermaid page will have content inside
    3. If screen width is less than 1250px, it will shoe a message to enlarge it

Some key features are:
    *You can move the girl object left and right with the keyboard
    *You can change pages without clicking by moving the girl to the far left or far right of the window(the page will change according to the order of list on the head navigation)
    *the girl will move up and down from indivisual project page with both scroll or keyboard
    *can download or view pdf of my resume
    *User can be interactive with this site by reading the terminal messages
        ex) write 'list' to see lists of my skills
        ex) click on individual projects
    *animations on images and descriptions
    *back-to-top button on the bottom right when scrolling in the individual project page
