	        					<li>Put laptop between yourself and the mirror so that you can read the questions on the screen but still see yourself in the mirror.</li>

	        			<p>
	        				<ul>
	        					<li>Try to keep your answers under one minute and 30 seconds (use the timer!) for general questions. For questions involving specific design projects you did, the responses can be longer.</li>
	        					<li>Use the STAR method when answering behavioral questions. <a href="http://www.uxbeginner.com/the-4-types-of-ux-interview-questions-to-master/">This site</a> provides a good overview of the type of questions and how to answer them.</li>
	        					<li>Note your body language and eye contact during your practice session.</li>

	        		<h4><u>about</u></h4>
	        			<p>This website was created as part of the Programming Usable Interfaces course (Fall 2016) as a final project. I conceived the idea for a behavioral interview website when I was undergoing co-op interviews back in undergrad and found a lack of resources for "live" practice. Specifically, I wanted an application that was designed to be used in conjunction with a mirror to mimic live practice without the need of finding an actual partner to conduct a mock interview. This would be beneficial for people who cannot find mock interview partners or for those who are first starting out and are uncomfortable with practicing in front of another person. I took my idea and adapted it to have design specific questions for this project. I hope you find this useful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Adena</p>
