    <p>I am currently a PhD candidate at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Dr. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/" target="_blank">Jason Hong</a> and Dr. <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/robert-kraut" target="_blank">Robert Kraut</a>. My research applies mobile sensing to study social relationships. </p>

    <p>More specifically, I am interested in <i>how everyday social interactions affect one's well-being</i>. How does interacting with friends or weak ties influence one's sense of loneliness? How will sharing a meal with someone change how happy or depressed they feel at the end of a day? Mobile sensing, combined with machine learning, allows me to predict occurrences of social interactions and the type of interactions (e.g., watching a movie or interacting with a colleague) without time-consuming surveys and questionnaires. This powerful method provides an abundance of rich data, on which I will apply statistical models to understand the role of social interactions in one's well-being.</p>

    <p>I consider myself as a relentless lifelong learner, seeking opportunities to hone and broaden my skill set. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and making some <a href="http://www.beeboopboop.com" target="_blank"> comics about my life </a>. I also value physical activities. My current exercise activities are swimming and yoga. </p>
