    <p>I am a 3rd year PhD student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Dr. Jason Hong and Dr. Robert Kraut. My research focuses on using mobile sensing to study human relationships. I am particularly interested in relationships between romantic couples, e.g., can data sensed on mobile phones tell us something about the nature of a romantic relationship? How does a romantic relationship differ from a friendship based on mobile phone data? </p>

    <p>I consider myself as a relentless lifelong learner, seeking opportunities to hone and broaden my skill set. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and making some <a href="http://www.beeboopboop.com" target="_blank"> comics about my life </a>. I also value physical activities. My current exercise activities are swimming and yoga. </p>
