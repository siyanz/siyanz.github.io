Siyan Zhao (si-YEN JOW)

I am currently a 2nd year PhD student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Dr. Jason Hong and Dr. Robert Kraut.

With a background in psychology, my research interest is to work with people and work for people. My current focus is using mobile sensing to learn about human relationships. I am particularly interested in relationships between romantic couples, e.g., can data sensed on mobile phones tell us something about the nature of a romantic relationship? How does a romantic relationship differ from a friendship based on mobile phone data? 

I consider myself as a lifelong learner, seeking opportunities to hone and broaden my skill set. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies and hanging out with friends. I also value physical activities. My current exercise activities are swimming and yoga.
