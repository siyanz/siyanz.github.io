Siyan Zhao (si-YEN JOW)

I am currently a 1st year PhD student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Dr. Roberta Klatzky and Dr. Dan Siewiorek.

With a background in psychology, my research interest is to work with people and work for people. I aim to learn about human cognition and apply the cognitive theories to make technology easier to use. My current focus is to construct a formalism that helps researchers model and control the behaviors of intelligent cognitive assistants. They are intelligent systems hosted in wearable devices, which can sense and provide automatic, yet tailored, feedback to users' actions. Juggling between theoretical cognitive work, computer vision, and helping build cognitive assistant applications, I am still in the process of exploring the broadness of the project. 

I consider myself as a lifelong learner, seeking opportunities to hone and broaden my skill set. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies and hanging out with friends. I also value physical activities. My current exercise activities are swimming and yoga.
