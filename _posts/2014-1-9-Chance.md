### Design Process

#### What is Chance?
Chance is a conceptual app that tracks your biking commute and matches you with other bike commuters in your area.

#### Why Chance?
Our background research on bikers showed that bikers feel an immediate connection to other bikers. This valuable piece of information brought us inspiration of building a mobile application that brings bikers together. As they share the commonality, they may find it appealing to date bikers who share similar values and lifestyles.

#### Who use Chance?
