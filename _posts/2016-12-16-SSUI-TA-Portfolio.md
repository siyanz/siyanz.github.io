In Fall 2016, I TA-ed a course called Programming User Interface and had the honor to work with a group of brilliant undergraduate and master students major or minor in HCI. As the teaching assistant for the course, I was responsible for a weekly lab session where students learned the fundamentals of interface prototyping, as well as the basics of HTML/CSS/javascript. For the final project, students were required to choose a project that reflects and showcases their particular interests within HCI user experience design. 

The brilliant students pleasantly surprised me with well thought-out projects. Many of them had no or little knowledge in prototyping and web programming. So this page is dedicated to them to showcase how much they have learned during the semester through their work.
