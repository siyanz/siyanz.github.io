THIS IS AN ONGOING PROJECT.

The project examines how the current pandemic situation has changed the way people socialize with one another and how these changes have impacted people's well-being. Specifically, we examine whether the social interactions that influence mental health varies with peopleâ€™s risk of social isolation, including factors such as marital, relationship and employment status, age and community-level compliance with local stay-at-home directives.

We have recently concluded our data collection with over 800 adults across the United States. Each participant completed multiple daily assessments for 3-weeks, including 8 Ecological Momentary Assessment surveys and 1 daily well-being and relationship survey at the end of the day.
