THIS IS AN ONGOING PROJECT.

The project examines how the current pandemic situation has changed the way people socialize with one another and how this change have impacted their well-being. Specifically, we examine whether the nature of the social interactions that influence mental health varies with peopleâ€™s risk of social isolation, including such factors as their marital, relationship and employment status, their age and community-level compliance with stay-at-home directives where they live.

We have recently concluded our data collection with over 800 adults across the United States. Each participant completed multiple daily assessments for 3-weeks, including multiple Ecological Momentary Assessment surveys and a daily well-being and relationship survey at the end of the day.
