Stereohaptics was originally born as a framework that enables haptic designers to quickly create, record, and playback haptic effects for media content. The concept is simple. Designers can use input tools, such as a microphone, to record haptic signals. Then using a commercial-available software, PureData, designers can modify how signals feel. Overtime, Stereohaptics evolved to a complete toolkit that can play haptic signals on different haptic output devices, e.g., vibrotactile and electric muscle stimulators, recorded using various input devices, e.g., microphones and accelerometers. We had the fortune to host a series of 5 design workshops all over the world. In this process, we improved our hardware design to accommodate different design needs and processes.
