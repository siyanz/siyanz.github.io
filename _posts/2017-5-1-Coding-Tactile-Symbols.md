### Project Description
We present a study to examine oneâ€™s learning and processing capacity of broadband tactile information, such
as that derived from speech. By associating 9 haptic custom-designed symbols to 9 phonemes using location of articulation, we demonstrated that novel users can recognize, learn, and retain the tactile symbols, aka haptic words. They can further generalize the knowledge to recognize new words that they have not trained on before.
