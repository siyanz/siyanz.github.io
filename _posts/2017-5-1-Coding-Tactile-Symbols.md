title: Coding Tactile Symbols for Phonetic Communication
shortinfo: This project explores the possibility of hearing with the skin. Published in the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2018).
year: 2018
month: May
categories: [Publications]
problem: With a large amount of information overloading people's visual and auditory senses, can we utilize people's skin to communicate content?
goal: To explore a method that associates haptic symbols with language, maximizing both how accurately people can recognize the symbols and how fast they can be delivered.

We designed a haptic device that associates 9 custom-made haptic symbols to different phonemes. Combining these phonemes, the device forms haptic words and plays on users' forearm to deliver information. Our lab study showed that, with approximately 25 minutes of training, users can recognize, learn, and remember the 9 haptic phonemes and 20 haptic words (sequences of haptic phonemes). The users can further generalize the knowledge to recognize new words that they have not trained on before.
