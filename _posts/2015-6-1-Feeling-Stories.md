### Project Description
Traditional story listening is losing its appeal to other entertainment technology such as video games. Hence, there is growing interest in studying the influence of ancillary media such as sound and interactive effects, although haptic sensory input has remained relatively unexploited. We implemented a haptic vest that generates vibrotactile stimulation related to story content to augment story listening. The results provide initial evidence that haptic effects can potentially enhance the reading/listening experience of children beyond 4 years.
